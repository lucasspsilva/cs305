## CS-305 SNHU
Artemis Financial, a financial company, wanted to improve the security of its application. This was important because they needed to protect critical information and keep a good reputation. My job involved finding and fixing software security problems. I focused mainly on static testing and checking dependencies. Checking dependencies was made easier by using a tool for dependency checking instead of doing it manually every time. Coding with safety in mind was very important because it kept the company's and its users' personal details safe from possible damage. This project highlighted that keeping current libraries is crucial for creating a secure software setting.

I often debugged and tested the software in the project to ensure it functioned correctly and was secure. This was done especially after refactoring our code to avoid creating new weaknesses. My way of making it more secure included updating old library versions and thinking about future strategies, such as penetration testing to check vulnerability risks better. For solving problems with coding, tools like Stack Overflow were very helpful in finding answers and comparing them with others at the same level. A part of this project that I would emphasize to future employers is using a hash function to make encrypted conversations safe. This shows my ability to create secure software solutions.
